# VERY-NEW-1054-Midterm-Assignment

In this file I've worked on why dogs are better than cat. Here with the help of css i've chnaged the background colour and I've also added a header section.

Here with the help form form and css I've created a navigation menu with subtle hover effer.

the navigation menu doesnot redirect anywhere as there is no link

i've rounded the corners of the image with css and added points with deatis using details and summary tag

here to highlight the hext i've used a mark tag since i had diffoculty with css
 and in the fotter section i've just added a background colour with css and a paragraph.

 There Images here are of same size and pixels.
